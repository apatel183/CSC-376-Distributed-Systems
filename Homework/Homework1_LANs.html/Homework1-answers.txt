1. ipconfig (or ifconfig, on Unix)

2. It looks up the IP address for a host name.

3. The netstat command provides information about network activity on a computer.

4. If successful, then you know that the host (computer) is running. If unsuccessful, the host may not be up, or ping is either turned off or prohibited by a firewall.

5. Local Area Network. A LAN is a network that connects nearby hosts directly.

6. A Network Interface Controller, also known as a NIC card. A cable, such as an Ethernet cable, may also be needed to connect the NIC to the network.

7. Hubs (also known as repeaters) and switches. A hub simply repeats the signal coming from one cable to all other attached cables, while a switch determines which cable to retransmit a signal to.

8. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). It maps a conceptual address, such as an IP address, to a hardware address, such as a MAC address.

9. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

10. It is a static IP.

11. Promiscuous mode permits a NIC to read all incoming network packets, regardless of their MAC destinations. It is used by network sniffer tools to diagnose network problems.
